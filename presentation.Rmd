## Instruction

1. To choose which set of lyrics to analyze, user could select the name and click the change button.

2. To change the minimum frequency of words to analyze, the user could slide the first bar so to adjust the choice of words, i.e. only words with frequency higher than the selected value could be shown in the word cloud. 

3. To change the number of words to be shown in the word cloud, the user could slide the second bar so to set a limitation of number of words on the screen.
